Despite being named as ML Model Card, they can also be used for Deep Learning and Generative AI models. </p> <p>A Model Card is key to share and reuse a model, providing essential human-readable context that makes a model trustworthy and truly reusable. They were first proposed by Google, see Model cards. They include information about the model, its intended use, training data, performance metrics, and ethical considerations. Although they are not yet well-adopted, some platforms such as Hugging Face facilitate their use by offering a template.</p> <p>In the long run, we believe that information from the Model Cards should also be part of Resaerch Mangement Plans for projects including the creation of AI models.</p> <p>These are our tutorials on the topic:</p> <ul> <li>Tutorial: Introduction to ML model cards</li> <li>Tutorial: Introduction to FAIR4ML, a vocabulary to describe FAIR AI models</li> <li>Tutorial: Introduction to MLentory, a metadata registry for AI models</li> </ul> <p>We have also contributed to the creation on a schema.org extension to represent AI Model Cards, in collaboration with the Research Data Alliance FAIR4ML Interest Group and the Ontology Engineering Group form the Polytechnic University of Madrid:</p> <ul> <li>Lifecycle for FAIR Machine Learning</li> <li>Towards metadata for machine learning - Crosswalk tables</li> <li>FAIR4ML schema</li> <li>FAIR4ML schema website</li> </ul>"},{"location":"data/","title":"Data management plans","text":"Data Management Plans <p>DMPs are probably better know than Software Management Plans as they are nowadays commonly requested by funders. A DMP helps researchers to focus on some steps needed to properly handle research data, from collection to publication and archiving. </p> <p>A metadata layer can be added to DMPs behind the scenes, so they become more interoperable and resusable, even across multiple DMP platforms. The Research Data Alliance DMP Commons Working Group started an effort on machine-actionable DMPs (maDMPs) around 2018, with the first version released towards the end of 2019. DMP4NFDI has already started mapping their DMP template to this RDA effort. </p> <p>We have contribute to the machine-actionability of DMPs with the organization of a hackathon from 28 to 30 October 2024, the outcomes are listed here: </p> <ul> <li>Crosswalks from the NFDI4DS hackathon \"machine-actionable Data Management Plan for NFDI\"</li> <li>Identification of core elements for a machine-actionable Data Management Plan metadata schema in the NFDI</li> </ul> <p>You can find more information on DMPs at DMP4NFDI and the Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO)</p>"},{"location":"software/","title":"Software management plans","text":"Software Management Plans <p>SMPs are similar to Data Management Plans but focusing on software rather than datasets. Ideally, they should not be defined on their own but together with a DMP, as they will share some common information related to the research project covering them both. SMPs are still new and not yet well-adopted. </p> <p>To raise awareness about SMPs, and make it easier for researchers to adopt them, we have offered some training and outreach. SMPs rely on good practices for research software development, aligned to the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable for Research Software (FAIR4RS) principles. We have focused then on those good practices that researchers can follow without adding much burden to their already busy schedule. </p> <p>Some of our presentations and tutorials are listed here: </p> <ul> <li>Introduction and tutorial on Metadata and SMPs for FAIR research software</li> <li>An introduction to machine-actionable Software Management Plans - Practical steps towards FAIR4RS</li> <li>Machine-Actionable Metadata for Software and Software Management Plans for NFDI - Presentation</li> <li>machine-actionable Software Management Plans</li> </ul> <p>Additional related material: </p> <ul> <li>An Introduction to Schema.org and JSON-LD</li> </ul> <p>We also created a schema.org-based metadata schema maSMPs as part of the activities at NFDI4DS.
