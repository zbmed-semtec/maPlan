<h1>Software Management Plans</h1> 

SMPs are similar to Data Management Plans but focusing on software rather than datasets. Ideally, they should not be defined on their own but together with a DMP, as they will share some common information related to the research project covering them both. SMPs are still new and not yet well-adopted. 

To raise awareness about SMPs, and make it easier for researchers to adopt them, we have offered some training and outreach. SMPs rely on good practices for research software development, aligned to the [Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable for Research Software (FAIR4RS) principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x). We have focused then on those good practices that researchers can follow without adding much burden to their already busy schedule. 

Some of our presentations and tutorials are listed here:
* [Introduction and tutorial on Metadata and SMPs for FAIR research software](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13799878)
* [An introduction to machine-actionable Software Management Plans - Practical steps towards FAIR4RS](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14866848)

We also created a schema.org-based metadata schema [maSMPs](https://zbmed-semtec.github.io/maSMPs/) as part of the activities at NFDI4DS. Further development of our maSMP metadata schema will continue now as part of DMP4NFDI. 

More information about SMPs available at [maSMPs](https://zbmed-semtec.github.io/maSMPs/), including links to the metadata schema, profiles, and publications.
