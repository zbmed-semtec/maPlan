<h1>Data Management Plans</h1> 

DMPs are probably better know than Software Management Plans as they are nowadays commonly requested by funders. A DMP helps researchers to focus on some steps needed to properly handle research data, from collection to publication and archiving. 

A metadata layer can be added to DMPs behind the scenes, so they become more interoperable and resusable, even across multiple DMP platforms. The [Research Data Alliance DMP Commons Working Group started an effort on machine-actionable DMPs (maDMPs)](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard) around 2018, with the first version released towards the end of 2019. DMP4NFDI has already started [mapping their DMP template to this RDA effort](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16737078). 

We have contribute to the machine-actionability of DMPs with the organization of a hackathon from 28 to 30 October 2024, the outcomes are listed here:
- [Crosswalks from the NFDI4DS hackathon "machine-actionable Data Management Plan for NFDI"](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15129829)
- [Identification of core elements for a machine-actionable Data Management Plan metadata schema in the NFDI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15130044)
