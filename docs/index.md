![NFDI4DataScience](nfdi4ds_logo_badge.png)  | ![DMP4NFDI](dmp4nfdi.png)  | A metadata service in collaboration between [NFDI4DataScience](https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/) and [DMP4NFDI](https://base4nfdi.de/projects/dmp4nfdi)

## Description

The creation of AI models involve research artifacts such as datasets and software, to finally obtain the AI model itself. These three artifcats should be managed along the research cycle in an integrated and harmonized way.

To achieve this, we propose a machine-actionable AI Research Plan (maPlan), which combines elements from Data Management Plans (DMPs) and Datasheets, Softaware Management Plans (SMPs), and Model Cards, together with metadata layers enabling machine-actionability.

## Current status

At the moment, in collaboration with [NFDI4DataScience](https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/) and [DMP4NFDI](https://base4nfdi.de/projects/dmp4nfdi), we are focusing on DMPs and SMPs plus the metadata layer required by them. 

Later we aim at adding elements from Datasheets and Model Cards.
