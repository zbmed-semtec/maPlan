<h1>AI Model Cards</h1> 

An ML Model Card is a structured document that accompanies a trained ML model. Despite being named as ML Model Card, they can also be used for Deep Learning and Generative AI models. 

A Model Card is key to share and reuse a model, providing essential human-readable context that makes a model trustworthy and truly reusable. They were first proposed by Google, see [Model cards](https://doi.org/10.1145/3287560.3287596). They include information about the model, its intended use, training data, performance metrics, and ethical considerations. Although they are not yet well-adopted, some platforms such as [Hugging Face facilitate their use by offering a template](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards).

In the long run, we believe that information from the Model Cards should also be part of Resaerch Mangement Plans for projects including the creation of AI models.

These are our tutorials on the topic:

* [Tutorial: Introduction to ML model cards](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17062307)
* [Tutorial: Introduction to FAIR4ML, a vocabulary to describe FAIR AI models](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17062369)
* [Tutorial: Introduction to MLentory, a metadata registry for AI models](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17062651)

We have also contributed to the creation on a schema.org extension to represent AI Model Cards, in collaboration with the [Research Data Alliance FAIR4ML Interest Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-machine-learning-fair4ml-ig) and the [Ontology Engineering Group](https://oeg.fi.upm.es/index.php/en/index.html) form the [Polytechnic University of Madrid](https://www.upm.es/):
